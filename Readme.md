# Blackjack Doubles

Blackjack Doubles is a spinoff of the popular card game Blackjack.
It requires two players to play, and a neutral dealer.

When starting the game, both players set an initial bet.
They are then dealt two cards each, face up, so that both
may see the other player's hand. A hand is any collection of cards.
Like Blackjack, you win if you score 21 points, or if you have a
higher score than the other player's corresponding hand while staying
under 21. You may have as many hands as you'd like.

However, when you split a hand, your bet automatically doubles.
At the end of the game, whether you stop betting or you run out of cards,
your hands will be compared to your opponent's hands, the best against the
best, and the winner will receive the prize money.
You'll both start out with 1000g, and the minimum bet is 20g. Good luck!
