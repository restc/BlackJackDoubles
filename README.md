# Blackjack Doubles

BlackJackDoubles is a spinoff of the popular card game Blackjack.
It requires two players to play, and a neutral dealer.

When starting the game, both players set an initial bet.
They are then dealt two cards each, face up, so that both
may see the other player's hand. A hand is any collection of cards.
Like Blackjack, you win if you score 21 points, or if you have a
higher score than the other player's corresponding hand while staying
under 21.

If you are dealt a duplicate card to your hand, your hand will
automatically split. When you split a hand, your bet also doubles.
At the end of the game, whether you stop betting or you run out of cards,
your hands will be compared to your opponent's hands, the best against the
best, and the winner will receive the prize money, with a bonus if you've
played more than one hand that didn't bust.

You'll both start out with 1000g, and the minimum bet to play is 20g.
Good luck!
